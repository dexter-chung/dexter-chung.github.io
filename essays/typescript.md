## My initial thoughts on TypeScript

As someone who is new to TypeScript, I thought at first that it would be very different compared to other programming languages. But I found it to be fairly similar to programming languages that I have already worked with such as Java and C. In terms of how it compares to other programming languages this one makes you have to specify the types for variables, functions, etc. which isn't far off from a programming language like Java which requires that too. So far, my experience with TypeScript overall has been really good, although every now and then I accidentally use types such a var, int, or string, instead of let or const out of habit from using previous coding languages, but that is kind of the only problem I ever have with it. One of the favorite things I like about TypeScript is how it shows errors in the code before it even executes which makes it easier for debugging. I think that TypeScript from a software engineering perspective is a good tool for a more organized program.

## The effectiveness of WODs

In my opinion I think WODs to be both challenging and fun. It is a great way to practice my problem solving skills and critical thinking. To me though, the most problematic part of the WODs is taking the time needed to fully understand what the prompt is asking us to do. The time pressure definitely does not help with that as I feel the need to rush as quickly as possible to coding based on the prompt which can lead to errors. But besides that I think these WODs will be helpful for me as I can get continuous practice everyday that can reinforce my programming skills. As I continue to do the WODs I hope that I will gain a better proficiency in TypeScript but also a better understanding of software engineering.

## My thoughts on TypeScript

As someone who is new to TypeScript, I thought at first that it would be very different compared to other programming languages. But I found it to be fairly similar to programming languages that I have already worked with such as Java and C. So far, my experience with TypeScript overall has been really good, although every now and then I accidentally use types such a var, int, or string, instead of let or const out of habit from using previous coding languages, but that is kind of the only problem I ever have with it. One of the favorite things I like about TypeScript is how it shows errors in the code before it even executes which makes it easier for debugging. I think that TypeScript from a software engineering perspective is a good tool for a more organized program.

## The effectiveness of WODs

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.



And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.

## First Impression

When I first started to program in VSCode using ESLint extension I was very supprised by how strict it was with how we format our code, where even missing a single space will point out a error. For the most part I thought that the is extension would make coding way more tedious. I at first thought that why does the way we code matter when in the end it still works the way we want it to. 

## Is it practical?

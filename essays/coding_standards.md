## First Impression of ESLint

Before I was introduced to ESLint most of the time I put barely any attention to how my code looks so long as it works. But when I first started to program in VSCode using ESLint extension I was very supprised by how strict it was with how we format our code, where even missing a single space will point out a error. For the most part I thought that the is extension would make coding way more tedious. I thought that why does the way we code matter when in the end it still works the way we want it to. But as I started to continue to code with the ESLint, it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Although ESLint puts a lot of emphasis on spacings which is still a bit annoying to deal with, I think overall using ESLint has helped me a good amount. It helped me to create a more organized and compiled code whether that be pointing out a unused variable or telling me to specify the type for one. I also find the errors it give to be very descriptive which helps me with debugging. 

## Is it practical?

Overall I think that coding standards is a great way to improve ones quality in coding. Dispite its tedious nature of nitpicking how every variable, spacing, or function is made it helps make more legible code where it makes it easier to spot and fix errors. Using Coding Standards not only makes it easier for you to read your own code, but it also makes it easier for others.

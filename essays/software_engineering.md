## Finding Interest

Early on in my life I was introduced to block-based coding platforms like Scratch and Code.org at school which was my first introduction to something programming related. I found great interest in them and thought they were very fun to use. I enjoyed the problem solving process which helped me with critical thinking. It also showed a glimpse of what programming can be used for whether that would be websites, games, or apps. 

This interest would then eventually lead me toward actual coding languages like for example Java. When working with an actual programming language it gave me more motivation to keep on learning about programming and computer science. In the process of practicing coding I gain a better understanding of the basics of programming. Overall I find that programming as a whole is a fun way to test myself and to reinforce my skills in critical thinking.

## Looking Forward

In the future, I look forward to further developing my skills in computer science, whether that would be in software, or even web development. Some examples for me would be to gain proficiency in programming languages like CSS or HTML and also with tools such as github. I want to be able to do projects that will help me to develop my problem solving skills but also let me gain more hands-on experience. One last thing I hope to gain in the future is better communication skills in a team setting when working on a project as it can lead to a more organized system between group members.
